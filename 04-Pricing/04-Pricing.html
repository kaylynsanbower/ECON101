# Institutional background

- Before 1900: Just don't go to the hospital! (at least in the U.S.)
  - mainly charity care
  - hospitals were a learning experience for physicians

- Early 1900s: big safety and technological improvements

- Mid 1900s: huge growth, especially in wealthy and urban areas
  - Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (Social Security Act)

---
# Now
As we know, we now spend &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; on health care in the U.S., and a big part of that is very high health care prices. (and a big part of that is hospital prices)

# What is a hospital price?

Lots of different payers paying lots of different prices:
- [Medicare fee-for-service prices](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AcutePaymtSysfctsht.pdf)
- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

# Hospital prices in real life
We'll get into the real data in a bit, but for now...a few facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive

2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas

3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?&lt;br&gt;

--

From an economics perspective:
- Hospital assumed to maximize some objective function, `\(u(q,z)\)`, subject to a production constraint

- `\(q\)` denotes quantity of care and `\(z\)` denotes quality of care

- Production is constrained by the break-even condition

---
# Non-profit hospitals
What does it mean to be a not-for-profit hospital?&lt;br&gt;

--

From a practical perspective:
- Profits must be re-invested into the hospital

- Must show "community benefit" (no consensus definition...includes uncompensated care, services to Medicaid, and certain specialized services that are generally unprofitable)

- No taxes! and tax-free bonds

---
# Non-profit hospitals and tax benefits
- &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;24.6 billion in tax exemptions in 2011

- &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;62.4 billion in "community benefits"&lt;br&gt;

- [Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/value-of-tax-breaks-for-nonprofit-hospitals-doubled-in-a-decade/2015/06/17/4162c640-1450-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?utm_term=.4f877a72a09f)&lt;br&gt;

--

What do you think? Are these community benefits measured appropriately?


---
# What is a non-profit hospital?
The real question is...what is the hospital's objective function?

- For-profit in disguise
- Output maximizers
- Tax-benefit maximizers
- Social welfare maximizers&lt;br&gt;

--

Most empirical evidence doesn't find much of a difference between FP and NFP hospitals, except FPs have higher prices. Why is that?


---
# For-profit hospitals
These are easier to study theoretically...just a standard profit maximizing firm.

- `\(\pi=P(q)q - C(q),\)` where `\(q\)` denotes quantity of care

- Firm has some market power and so faces a downward sloping demand curve

# Pricing and Negotiations

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Pricing for NFP hospitals
Objective is to maximize some function of profits and quantity of care provided, denoted by&lt;br&gt;

`\(U\left( \pi_{j} = \pi_{i,j} + \pi_{g,j},D_{i,j}, D_{g,j} \right)\)`&lt;br&gt;

where `\(\pi_{j}\)` denotes total profits for hospital `\(j\)` and `\(D_{i,j}\)` denotes hospital demand from insurer `\(i\)`. We assume that `\(p_{j}\)` is exogenous and determined by a public payer, so the hospital need only set its price for private insurance customers, `\(p_{i}\)`.

---
# Solution for NFP hospital
The hospital chooses `\(p_{i}\)` such that&lt;br&gt;

`\(\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}} = U_{1} \pi_{1}^{i} + U_{2} \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}=0\)`,&lt;br&gt;

where `\(U_{1}\)` denotes the derivative of `\(U(\cdot)\)` with respect to its first argument and similarly for `\(U_{2}\)`.&lt;br&gt;

--

In general, we can't solve this directly without knowing the hospital's utility function. 


---
# Assuming pure profit maximization
&lt;img src="04-Pricing_files/figure-html/tikz-fp-pricing-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Example

Consider the firm's demand curve, `\(d=16-q\)`, and cost curve, `\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\)`. Where will the firm produce and at what price? What is the firm's markup over marginal cost?


---
# Negotiating with insurers
- Hospitals can't set price on their own
- Negotiation with insurers
- Bargaining problem where insurer and hospital split some total amount
- Agent/entity with higher bargaining position will get larger share

--
# Understanding the outside option
Key part of understanding effect on price is to understand the "outside option". What does this mean?&lt;br&gt;

--

Outside option in this case is the profit to the hospital or insurer if a negotiation "breaks down". What is the outside option to an insurer if they are in a monopoly hospital market?

# Fixed Prices

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
# Types of fixed prices
- Health care providers also face a fixed price from Medicare and Medicaid
- Variation across hospitals, but hospital has no control over it's individual price


---
# Background on Medicare
- Created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally health insurance to those 65 years of age and older
- Expanded to include certain disabilities (20% now below age 65)
- Consists of four parts:
  1. Part A: Hospital Insurance
  2. Part B: "Medical" Insurance (physician visits and outpatient care)
  3. Part C: Private supplemental care (Medicare plus Choice, now Medicare Advantage)
  4. Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage

---
# Medicare Part A
- Automatic enrollment for anyone 65 and older who worked over their lifetime
- Financed with combination of payroll tax (current workers) and cost-sharing (deductibles, etc.)
- Funds exist as part of "Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund"...can't finance through debt
- Benefit structure:
  - Very good for short inpatient stays
  - Very bad for major problems with long stays
  - Doesn't cover nursing home care beyond 30 days

---
# Medicare Part B
- Voluntary, but almost everyone enrolls
- Requires monthly premium ($144 in 2020)
- Small deductible and 20% co-insurance


---
# Medicare Part C
- Private insurance provision of Medicare benefits
- Formally created under Balanced Budget Act in 1997 (existed informally before)
- Heavily revised in Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Medicare pays insurers a risk-adjusted amount to enroll a given beneficiary
- Broader benefits than Part A and B, often with $0 additional premiums, but restrictive networks

---
# Medicare Part D
- Created under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003
- Private insurance for prescription drugs
- Insurers receive payments from Medicare to enroll a given beneificiary (much like Part C)
- Many insurers offer a combined Part C+D plan

---
# Privatization of Medicare
- Medicare Advantage (both Parts C and D) has been well-received and generally thought to be a success story for Medicare benefits
- Accounts for nearly 40% of total Medicare enrollees
- Some early difficulties with adverse selection and risk-adjustment
- Still slightly sicker people staying in traditional Medicare
- Could be a &lt;b&gt;big&lt;/b&gt; part of any future "Medicare-for-all" type program

---
# Medicare payments
- Prospective payment system
- Begin with two "base" rates:
  - Operating base payment rates, &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;5,797 in 2020
  - Capital base payment rates, &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;462 in 2020
- Adjustments:
  - Diagnosis Related Group (higher adjustments for more complicated things)
  - Academic Medical Center
  - Disproportionate Share


---
# Background on Medicaid
- Also created by the Social Security Act in 1965
- Originally provided health insurance to people receiving "Aid to Families with Dependent Children", mainly extremely poor families
- Expanded over time with different rules by state
- Huge program: about 40% of births are covered by Medicaid/CHIP and 1 in 3 birhts!

---
# ACA and Medicaid Expansion
- Big part of ACA was Medicaid expansion
- Originally mandatory but made voluntary by Supreme Court
- Expansion covers all adults (with or without children) below age 65 and with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line ($35,535 for family of 4 in 2020)
  
---
# Medicaid Funding
- Paid for by states and federal funding
- State funding is matched by federal funds, and the match amount depends on the state's per capita income
- Incentivizes services to be provided by Medicaid that historically may not be

---
# Medicaid Benefits
- Pretty generous coverage
- Low to no copayments, deductibles, co-insurance
- Usually covers dental, vision, hospitals, and physician services
- Covers long term care (unlike Medicare). About 40% of all long term care is paid for by Medicaid.
- Growth in Medicaid managed care

---
# Medicaid Payments
- Works similarly to Medicare with a base rate plus adjustments
- Base rates vary by state Medicaid agencies
- Adjustments (or supplemental payments) consist of:
  - Disproportionate share adjustments 
  - Other (non-DSH) adjustments
  - Account for a little less than half of total Medicaid payments on average

# Two-price Market

---
# Relationship between prices
In health care, providers usually face two prices:

1. A price fixed by Medicare and Medicaid, `\(p_{m}\)`.
2. A price that is negotiated with insurers, `\(p_{n}\)`.

How does `\(p_{m}\)` affect `\(p_{n}\)`?&lt;br&gt;

---
# Two price market and NFP
Although we don't know the general solution for the private price, we can find how it varies with the public price...&lt;br&gt;

--

`$$\frac{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{j}} = - \frac{U_{11}\pi_{1}^{i}\pi_{1}^{j} + \frac{\mathrm{d}D_{i}}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}}U_{12}\pi_{1}^{j}}{\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}U}{\mathrm{d}p_{i}^{2}}}$$`

---
# Two price market and FP
.pull-left[
- Sell to "private" market as long as marginal revenue exceeds the public price
- Switch to "public'" market otherwise, and sell to the point where price equals marginal cost
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="04-Pricing_files/figure-html/tikz-fp-twoprice-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
# Two price market example
Consider the firm's demand curve in the private insurance market, `\(d=16-q\)`, and costs, `\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\)`. Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of `\(\bar{p}=10\)`. How many private patients will the provider serve? How many public patients? What if `\(\bar{p}\)` drops to &lt;span&gt;&amp;#36;&lt;/span&gt;9.

---
# Cost-shifting
- Relationship between public and private price is important
- Speaks to anticipated effects of a change in Medicaid or Medicare rates
- Do hospitals "make up" the difference?&lt;br&gt;

--

The idea that hospitals will increase private prices following a decrease in the public price is called &lt;b&gt;cost shifting&lt;/b&gt;. 

---
# Cost-shifting
But how could it happen?&lt;br&gt;

--

Assumes that hospitals could have increased private prices earlier but chose not too. This is technically possible if, for example:
- Hospital has very low margins (maybe negative with a lower public price)
- Insurer wants to prop up the hospital for competitive reasons
- Hospital has diminishing returns to profits&lt;br&gt;

--

but economists usually see this as a smaller effect than most policy makers.

# Pay for performance
There are three main pay for performance programs employed in Medicare right now:
1. Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
2. Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program
3. [Quality Payment Program](https://qpp.cms.gov/about/qpp-overview) for physicians: Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs)

---
# Capitated Payments
There are two forms of capitated payments in Medicare now:
1. Bundled Payments
2. Accountable Care Organizations
