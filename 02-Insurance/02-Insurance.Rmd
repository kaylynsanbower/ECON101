# Insurance and Risk

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>

---
# Describing risk
We need three things to define risk in this class:
1. Probability
2. Expected value
3. Preferences (i.e., a utility function)

---
# 1. Probability
Definition: The likelihood that a given outcome will occur.<br>

--

Important to note the timing here...probability applies to an uncertain event that may have several possible outcomes. For example, I may have a heart attack or I may not. [Risk Calculator](http://www.cvriskcalculator.com/).

---
# 2. Expected value
Definition: The probability weighted average of the payoffs (or costs) associated with all possible outcomes.<br>

--

For two potential outcomes, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, with probabilities $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$:<br>

$E[x] = p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}$

---
# Example
What is my expected cost?
- Two possible outcomes: heart attack or no heart attack
- 10% chance of having a heart attack
- Cost of <span>&#36;</span>100,000 if I have a heart attack (but I will survive and recover)<br>

---
# Answer

I will incur a cost of <span>&#36;</span>100,000 with 10% probability. So my expected cost is just $E[cost]=0.1*100,000 =$ `r format(0.1*100000,digits=5,big.mark=",")`.

---
# 3. Preferences
Definition: Preferences take the form of a utility function, $u(x)$, which tells us how much we benefit get from some consumption bundle, $x$.<br>

--

Expected utility the combines expected value and utility...<br>
$E[u(x)] = p_{1}u(x_{1}) + p_{2}u(x_{2})$

---
# Risk preferences
With probabilities, expected values, and utilities/preferences, we can now measure preferences toward risk. <br>

--

- <b>Risk averse:</b> We prefer to avoid the risky situation. You would rather have the same (or slightly less) with certainty than a lottery over two risky outcomes.

- <b>Risk neutral:</b> Indifferent between the risky situation or that of certainty.

- <b>Risk loving:</b> Prefer the risky situation. 

---
# Risk aversion
Most common assumption is that individuals are risk averse. Mathematically, this follows from diminishing marginal utility.<br>

--

$u'(x_{1}) > u'(x_{2})$ for $x_{1} < x_{2}$<br>
What does this mean in words?

# In-class Problem: Expected values
An individual starts with a wealth of <span>&#36;</span>100,000. With probability 0.3, they will get sick and incur a cost of <span>&#36;</span>40,000.

1. What is this person's expected cost of illness?
2. Assume this individual has a utility function of the form, $u(w) = w^{0.20}$. What is this person's expected utility?
3. Calculate this person's utility if they were to incur the cost of illness with certainty. Is this utility higher or lower than what you found in part (2)?

# Demand for Health Insurance

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>

---
# Why purchase health insurance?
Say your utility function is $u(w)=\sqrt{w}$ and that you're starting with $w=$ <span>&#36;</span>100. I propose a lottery in which I flip a coin...heads you win <span>&#36;</span>20 and tails you lose <span>&#36;</span>20. <br>

--

1. What is the expected monetary value of this lottery? 

2. What is your utility at this expected value? 

3. What is the expected utility from this lottery?

---
# Answer
```{r include=FALSE}
ew <- .5*80+.5*120
eu <- .5*sqrt(80) + .5*sqrt(120)

```
Expected wealth is simply $\frac{1}{2} \times 80 + \frac{1}{2} \times 120 =$ `r format(ew,digits=3)`, which yields a utility of $u(w)=$ `r format(sqrt(ew),digits=3)`. But your expected utility is $\frac{1}{2} \times u(w_{heads}) + \frac{1}{2} \times u(w_{tails}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{80} + \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{120} =$ `r format(eu, digits=3)`.

# Risk premium

The maximum amount of money that a risk-averse person is willing to pay to avoid the risky scenario. In other words, the amount of money that makes a person indifferent between the certain and uncertain situations.<br>

--

This is part of how we measure willingness-to-pay for health insurance.

# Example
Consider the utility function, $u(w)=\ln(w)$. An individual starts with a wealth of <span>&#36;</span>100,000. With probability 0.25, this person will get sick and incur a cost of <span>&#36;</span>20,000. Their wealth in the sick state is therefore <span>&#36;</span>80,000. What is the maximum amount this person is willing to pay for health insurance?<br>

--

1. Calculate expected wealth, $E[w]$.
2. Calculate expected utility, $E[U(w)]$.
3. Calculate value of wealth that gives you $u=E[U(w)]$ (based on the utility function).
4. Calculate the risk premium as the difference between (1) and (3).
5. Calculate maximum willingness to pay by adding the risk premium and the expected cost.

---
# Answer
```{r, include=FALSE}
ecost <- .25*20000
eu <- .75*log(100000) + .25*log(80000)
inv.u <- exp(eu)
wtp <- 100000-inv.u
```
We're asked to find some wealth level, $y$, such that the person is indifferent between $y$ with certainty versus the risky wealth levels, $w_{h}=$ <span>&#36;</span>100,000 with probability 0.75 or $w_{s}=$ <span>&#36;</span>80,000 with probability 0.25.<br>

The person's expected utility with uncertainty is: $E[u]=0.75\times \ln (100000) + 0.25 \times \ln (80000) =$ `r eu`. We therefore need to find $y$ such that $u(y)=$ `r eu`. Given our utility function, this is satisfied for $y=$ <span>&#36;</span>`r format(inv.u,digits=5,big.mark=",")`. Since the person starts with <span>&#36;</span>100,000, they are willing to pay a maximum of <span>&#36;</span>100,000 $-$ <span>&#36;</span>`r format(inv.u,digits=5,big.mark=",")` $=$ <span>&#36;</span>`r format(wtp,digits=5,big.mark=",")` for health insurance.

Finally, since the expected cost of care is <span>&#36;</span>`r format(ecost,digits=5,big.mark=",")`, we can break this <span>&#36;</span>`r format(wtp,digits=5,big.mark=",")` into its actuarily fair premium of <span>&#36;</span>`r format(ecost,digits=5,big.mark=",")` plus the loading factor or risk premium of <span>&#36;</span>`r format(wtp-ecost,digits=5,big.mark=",")`.

# In-class Problem: Demand for insurance
Assume that utility takes the log form, $u(x)=ln(x)$. If someone is healthy, they maintain their current wealth of <span>&#36;</span>100, and if they become ill, they must incur a cost of <span>&#36;</span>50. Answer the following questions based on this setup.

1. Calculate the risk premium and willingness to pay based on a probability of illness of 0.1.
2. Repeat part (1) using a probability of illness of 0.2.
3. Repeat part (1) using a probability of illness of 0.5.
4. Explain how these values differ and why. What might this say about the profitability of insurance in a market with many sick people?


---
# What affects the risk premium?

Based on the graph, what do you think are some things that might affect the risk premium?<br>

--

1. Curvature of the utility function

2. Probability of illness

3. Cost of illness


---
# High risk pools

- A "high-risk pool" is a way to put people that are more likely to incur high medical costs all in one plan. 
- Recalling the curvature of demand function, probability of illness, and cost of illness...do you think a high-risk pool is sustainable (think about the profit to the insurer)?<br>

--

Let's look at this in practice, [KFF High-risk Pools](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/)


---
# Other reasons to buy health insurance

1. Increase bargaining power with providers

2. Manage where care is delivered (due to information problems in health care decisions)


---
# Main takeaways

1. Explain and show graphically how changes in the utility function, probability of illness, and the cost of illness affect the risk premium

2. Calculate amount of insurance individuals would purchase under given assumptions

# Adverse selection
In practice, people know more about their health than insurers. This is a form of <b>asymmetric information</b>.


---
# Textbook adverse selection
```{tikz echo=FALSE, fig.ext='png', cache=TRUE, tikz-selection}

\end{tikzpicture}
```

---
# Possible outcomes

1. Demand above AC: full insurance and no problems from adverse selection
2. Demand intersects AC at some point: underinsurance from people willing and able but ultimately not purchasing
3. Demand below AC: death spiral! (or, less dramatic, unraveling)<br>

--

Show this on your own with three different graphs.


---
# Example
Assume the insurer's cost function is $C=100q - 2q^{2}$, where $q$ denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that demand is given by $D=140-4q$. Assuming the insurer enters the market with $p_{1}=40$,<br>

1. What is the next year's price (if profits are <span>&#36;</span>0 based on period 1)? 
2. What is the equilibrium price?

---
# Answer
To solve this, we need to first calculate the marginal cost curve, $mc=100-4q$, and the average cost curve, $ac=100-2q$. At a price of $p=40$, we know that quantity demanded will be $q=25$. At that point, the average cost is then <span>&#36;</span>50. Since $AC>p$, the firm is losing money. If they set prices to break-even, then next period's price would be set to their observed AC, $p_{2}=$ <span>&#36;</span>50. We can find the equilibrium price as the point where the AC and D curves intersect, which occurs at $q$ of 20 and price of <span>&#36;</span>60.


---
# In-class Problem: Adverse selection
Assume that the insurer's cost function is given by $C=100q - 2q^{2}$, where $q$ denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that the inverse demand function takes the form, $D=110 - 3q$, and that there are 20 individuals total in this market.

1. If the insurer enters the market at a price of <span>&#36;</span>65, what is the insurer's profit (or loss)?
2. What price does the insurer set next year if they set price equal to average cost in the prior year?
3. What is the equilibrium price in this market?
4. What if there is a <span>&#36;</span>10 penalty imposed for those that do not purchase health insurance?

# Some potential policy solutions

1. Subsidize consumers
2. Subsidize insurers
3. Mandate purchases<br>

--

Can you show each of these solutions graphically?


---
# Advantageous selection
What if individuals who are high risk are also less risk-averse? In this case, individuals who are willing to pay the most for health insurance (the most risk averse) are actually less risky and therefore the cheapest to insure. Very different policy implications (e.g., individual mandate is bad in this case). 


---
# Main takeaways
1. Explain, using a graph, how unravelling could occur in a market with adverse selection.

2. Discuss and show graphically how an individual mandate or subsidies could help to alleviate or minimize the adverse selection problem.
