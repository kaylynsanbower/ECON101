# Econ 372: Economics of Health Care Markets

This is an elective economics course focusing on "supply side" health economics issues taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. The course examines the industrial organization of health care markets in the U.S., including underlying theory,
empirical findings, and related health care policy. We will study insurance markets, informational asymmetries between physicians and patients, as well as issues of hospital pricing and payments

Before going much further, please be sure to read the [syllabus](Syllabus/Econ372-Syllabus.pdf). This will give you a sense of what to expect in the course as well as details of specific assignments and projects. Below are the lecture notes and underlying code files for the class. This site is very much a work in progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. 

## Moving Online...

As I mentioned in my announcement on Canvas, our online class structure will be a blend of "synchronous" and "asynchronous". This means we will try to maintain *some* of the same schedule as we would with in-person classes, supplemented with online materials that can be viewed whenever is convenient for you. The synchronous portions of classes (i.e., live virtual class discussions) may not work for everyone, as I know some of us are in different time zones and some of us may have intermittent internet access. As a backup option, all of our virtual meetings will be recorded and made available on this website, so the material will be out there if you can't make it to any given "virtual" meeting.

Here's a quick breakdown of how things will (hopefully) work for the rest of the semester. Effectively, each class time will be split into a pre-recorded set of notes and a virtual class discussion/practice problem.<br>
1. I will post brief pre-recorded lectures for everyone to watch at 8:30am every Monday and Wednesday, in line with our regularly scheduled class time. These recorded lectures will follow my slides that are already posted [below](#notes-and-slides). In total, the pre-recorded material for each day should take no more than 30 minutes.
2. The recorded notes will be accompanied by a set of discussion questions or practice problems, which will serve as our material for the virtual portion of each class. After reviewing the pre-recorded lectures, everyone should spend 10 to 20 minutes on these activities.
3. Log in to our Econ 372 Zoom Room to participate in the virtual classroom. Since anyone with the link can log in, I've only posted the Zoom link on our Canvas page. Also on our Canvas page is a separate meeting room link for my Zoom office hours.

The recorded lecture and relevant discussion questions or practice problems for our virtual class will be made available as part of our regular [weekly guides](weekly-guides.html). All of our viritual class meetings will also be recorded and posted in the same place. 

The [weekly guides](weekly-guides.html) will be your key source of information going forward. This is where you'll find recorded lectures for each class, the discussion topics/practice problems relevant for each virtual class, and the recorded virtual classes for reference purposes.

For every class, I will log in to our Zoom classroom by 9:00am. This will allow everyone time to watch the pre-recorded materials and begin working through the actvities or practice problems. For the first 15 minutes (9:00am to 9:15am), I will simply be available for questions as you work through the activities. From 9:15am to 9:45am, everyone who is able should join the virtual classroom to participate in a group discussion. Depending on the number of people attending the virtual class, I may turn off the video options, in which case everyone will have to submit comments using the chat feature. But we'll make those decisions on a class-by-class basis.

If you can't make it to the virtual class, please be sure to watch the recorded class afterward. I will be happy to discuss any remaining questions during my virtual office hours.

## Notes and slides
Below are all of the slides that I'll use throughout the class. The slides will open as html files. Note that I've disabled "touch" navigation, which means that it's not possible to advance the slides with a touchscreen. I did this because I will record the screen in each class, and I'll annotate the slides throughout the class. If you want to see the slides in standard presentation format, you will need to access everything on a desktop or laptop rather than a phone or tablet. Everything is still accessible on a mobile platform, you just need to open the "simplified" view. I've provided a link for that view in each section. The simplified view will remove the slide/presentation formatting and allow you just to see the whole content as one big website. Some content won't display in the same way, but the content itself will be there.
